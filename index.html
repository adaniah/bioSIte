                    <h3>Her testimony</h3>
                    <p id="JesusRocks" class="steppingstones"> “I was born into a family that was catholic, but we received the gift of salvation through personal relationship with God through Christ in my younger years. True freedom is not found in religion but in relationship. Although I grew up in a Christian home, there was still hardships to deal with. Through it all, I have always thought of Jesus my Refugee and my Saving Grace. Then at the age of 18, shortly after I graduated from high school, was when I recommited my heart and life to Jesus Christ. I have traveled on this journey with God for many years. I have been growing to know the Love of God, which passes knowledge, towards others, as well as myself. I have led and written many bible studies throughout the years, both personal and in groups. The life of God has reignited my walk of faith in significant times throughout my journey. I have been grateful to passs on hope, help, health, healing, and freedom to others from what I’ve learned, and things I have gone through or continue togrow through. My passion is to impart the revelation of the present-tenseness of the living Christ in the here and now and as well as empowering others to come into a deeper and ongoing connection with God thereby enjoying an open door to the highest Heaven.”
