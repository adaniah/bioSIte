                <div class="steppingstones">
                    <p>Marina Ode is a SoCal Resident and has lived here her whole life. She feels very blessed and privileged to have called SoCal home for so long. She has had the pleasure of raising her daughter for 21 years; including being a homeschooling mom and teacher. She has done many part-time jobs throughout her life including being a Math tutor, teaching high school homeschool science along with teaching other college courses, and being a Pilates instructor among other things. She completed her Bachelor’s Degree of Biological Sciences in 2006, after attending a couple of different universities and colleges, and taking some time off to have and care for her daughter. She deeply enjoys studying how science reflects God’s magnificent creation.</p>

                <div class="steppingstones">
                    <p>Her adult life has been devoted to raising her daughter and pets, and pursuing her hobbies, interests and passions. Her main passion, though, is living for God and shining His Light and Love wherever she goes and in whatever she does. She is a positive person that surrounds herself with inspirational things, and encouraging people, in every aspect of her life. She is a firm believer in (with lots of hope for) making our world a better place for the future generations to come.</p>

                    <p id="JesusRocks"> “I was born into a family that was catholic, but we received the gift of salvation through personal relationship with God through Christ in my younger years. True freedom is not found in religion but in relationship. Although I grew up in a Christian home, there was still hardships to deal with. Through it all, I have always thought of Jesus my Refugee and my Saving Grace. Then at the age of 18, shortly after I graduated from high school, was when I recommited my heart and life to Jesus Christ. I have traveled on this journey with God for many years. I have been growing to know the Love of God, which passes knowledge, towards others, as well as myself. I have led and written many bible studies throughout the years, both personal and in groups. The life of God has reignited my walk of faith in significant times throughout my journey. I have been grateful to pass on hope, help, health, healing, and freedom to others from what I’ve learned, and things I have gone through or continue to grow through. My passion is to impart the revelation of the present-tenseness of the living Christ in the here and now and as well as empowering others to come into a deeper and ongoing connection with God thereby enjoying an open door to the highest Heaven.” </p>
