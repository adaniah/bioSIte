Short testimony: “I grew up in a Christian home but at the age of 18, when I rededicated my life to Jesus Christ, I became radical for God & His Kingdom. I am passionate for believers to stay on fire, pressing on, being real, living free, and proclaiming/living the gospel to the world as signs & miracles follow.”
